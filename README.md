# Classification on  102 Class Flower Dataset

## Overview:

This repository presents a successful classification project using the Oxford 102 Flower Dataset. The dataset comprises 102 diverse flower categories, with a minimum of 40 images per class. The focus of this project is to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate and efficient flower category classification.

## Classification Results:

- **Training Accuracy:** 62%
- **Validation Accuracy:** 25%
- **Loss:** 1.34
- **This is on 5 epoch only**

## Methodology:

The classification task involved the following key steps:

1. **Dataset Preparation:**
   - The Oxford 102 Flower Dataset was organized and split into training and validation sets.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was employed for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. The architecture included convolutional layers for feature extraction and dense layers for classification.

3. **Training:**
   - The model was trained on the training set using an appropriate optimization algorithm and loss function.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - The trained model's performance was evaluated on a separate validation set to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities.
